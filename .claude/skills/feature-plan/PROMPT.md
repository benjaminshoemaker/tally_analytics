# Feature Execution Plan Generator Prompt

Use this prompt to generate an execution plan for implementing a **new feature** in an **existing project**:
- **EXECUTION_PLAN.md** - Detailed phase/step/task breakdown for the feature
- **Feature-local AGENTS.md** - Scoped workflow guidance for agents working in `features/<name>/`

This prompt requires your existing `AGENTS.md` file as input to ensure compatibility and identify any workflow gaps.

---

## The Prompt

```
I need you to generate an execution plan for implementing a new feature in my existing project.

Read `~/.claude/skills/shared/EXECUTION_PLAN_FORMAT.md` for the execution hierarchy definitions,
verification types, EXECUTION_PLAN.md template structure, task quality checks, red flags, and
post-generation checklist. Use those definitions verbatim — do not redefine or paraphrase them.

Before assigning any (MANUAL) or (MANUAL:DEFER) tag to an acceptance criterion or checkpoint item,
read `~/.claude/skills/auto-verify/PATTERNS.md` and walk through the MANUAL Decision Tree (steps 1-9).
Only assign MANUAL if you reach step 9 (subjective judgment). If any earlier step matches, use the
automated verification type instead.

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before generating the execution plan:

1. **Review existing AGENTS.md**
   - Understand the current workflow (task execution steps, context management)
   - Note what verification methods are defined (testing policy, manual checks)
   - Identify any gaps: Does the feature need workflow elements not currently defined?
   - Common gaps to check for:
     - Browser/UI verification workflows
     - Regression testing requirements
     - Database migration procedures
     - External service integration patterns

2. **Understand the existing project**
   - Review the project structure and architecture
   - Identify relevant existing patterns (error handling, state management, API design)
   - Note testing conventions and frameworks in use
   - Understand the deployment model

3. **Map integration points**
   - Which existing files need modification?
   - Which existing components will the feature interact with?
   - Are there shared utilities, hooks, or services to reuse?
   - What interfaces or types already exist that apply?

4. **Identify risks and dependencies**
   - Could this feature break existing functionality?
   - Are there migration concerns (database, config, etc.)?
   - Does this require new external services or dependencies?

5. **Plan the phases**
   - Phase 1 is typically foundation/infrastructure for the feature
   - Middle phases build core functionality incrementally
   - Final phase handles polish, edge cases, and cleanup

6. **Ensure backward compatibility**
   - Existing tests must continue to pass
   - Public APIs should not break (or require migration path)
   - Consider feature flags if incremental rollout is needed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FEATURE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When planning feature work, explicitly address:

**Data Layer Changes**
- New database tables/columns needed?
- Migrations required?
- Changes to existing data models?

**API Changes**
- New endpoints?
- Modifications to existing endpoints?
- Versioning considerations?

**UI Changes**
- New components?
- Modifications to existing components?
- Routing changes?

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for new code
- Integration tests for feature flows
- Regression tests for modified existing code

**Rollback Plan**
- Can the feature be disabled without deployment?
- Are database changes reversible?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INPUTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Existing AGENTS.md (Required)

{Paste or attach your current AGENTS.md file. This is required to:}
- Ensure the execution plan uses compatible workflow patterns
- Identify gaps that need new workflow additions
- Maintain consistency with your established conventions

---

## Current Project Context

{Provide one or more of the following:}

### Option A: Key Files
- Project structure (tree output or key directories)
- README.md or project documentation
- Relevant existing code files the feature will interact with

### Option B: Summary Description
If you can't provide files, describe:
- Tech stack (language, framework, database, etc.)
- Architecture pattern (monolith, microservices, etc.)
- Key components the feature will touch
- Testing approach (Jest, Pytest, etc.)

---

## Feature Specification Documents (Required)

{Paste or attach both documents from the previous workflow steps:}

### FEATURE_SPEC.md
- What the feature does (user-facing behavior)
- Target users and core user experience
- Integration points with existing functionality
- Scope boundaries

### FEATURE_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Data model changes and migration strategy
- API contracts (new and modified endpoints)
- Files to create and modify
- Regression risk assessment

Read the local file `AGENTS_TEMPLATE.md` (in this skill's directory) and use its contents as the feature-local `AGENTS.md` format template (do not paraphrase or summarize — use the template verbatim, filling in project-specific values).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Generate:
1. EXECUTION_PLAN.md
2. `features/<name>/AGENTS.md`

Note: The execution plan references FEATURE_SPEC.md and FEATURE_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
(your feature specification documents) instead of PRODUCT_SPEC.md and TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
for context management purposes.
```

---

## Follow-Up Prompts

### To refine specific tasks:
```
Review Task {X.Y.Z} and improve:
1. Make acceptance criteria more specific and testable
2. Clarify which existing files need modification
3. Identify patterns from existing code to follow
4. Check dependencies are accurate
```

### To handle discovered complexity:
```
While exploring the codebase, I found {discovery}.

Update the execution plan to account for this:
1. Adjust affected tasks
2. Add new tasks if needed
3. Update dependencies
```

### To add incremental scope:
```
We need to also support {additional requirement}.

Update EXECUTION_PLAN.md to include this:
1. Determine which phase it belongs in
2. Create new tasks or modify existing ones
3. Update dependencies
```

### To handle breaking changes:
```
This feature requires breaking changes to {component}.

Add a migration phase that:
1. Documents the breaking change
2. Provides migration path for existing code
3. Updates affected tests
```

## After Generation Checklist

```
EXECUTION_PLAN.md
(Run the checklist from EXECUTION_PLAN_FORMAT.md, then also check:)
□ Every task in FEATURE_SPEC.md has at least one corresponding task
□ Every requirement in FEATURE_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md has implementation coverage

Feature-local AGENTS.md Quality
□ Contains ONLY workflow/process guidance for work in `features/<name>/`
□ Defaults to "no additional feature-specific workflow rules" when root AGENTS.md already covers the workflow
□ Does NOT include feature-specific commit examples
□ Does NOT include acceptance criteria details (those are in EXECUTION_PLAN.md)
□ Does NOT include implementation details or domain knowledge
□ Does NOT document specific components, patterns, or architecture of this feature
□ Every feature-specific addition passes the litmus test: "Would this be useful for a DIFFERENT feature in a DIFFERENT project?"
□ Keeps durable project rules in the root AGENTS.md instead of duplicating them

AGENTS.md Compatibility (check for gaps)
□ All verification methods in EXECUTION_PLAN.md are covered by root AGENTS.md or feature-local AGENTS.md
□ If browser verification is used, the applicable instruction file covers browser verification workflow
□ If regression checks are needed, the applicable instruction file covers regression testing policy
□ If migrations are needed, the applicable instruction file covers migration workflow
□ Feature-local additions are provided ONLY for actual workflow gaps identified
```

## Review Your Output

Before finalizing, verify:
- Every task in FEATURE_SPEC.md has at least one corresponding task in EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- Every requirement in FEATURE_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md has implementation coverage
- Task estimates are realistic and dependencies are correctly ordered
- No spec requirements were lost or misinterpreted during plan generation

## Phase 1: Data Layer

**Goal:** Establish database schema and data access patterns for notifications
**Depends On:** None

### Pre-Phase Setup
- [ ] Confirm database migration tooling is working
  - Verify: `{migration command} --help`
- [ ] Review existing schema patterns in `src/lib/db/`
  - Verify: `rg "CREATE TABLE users" src/lib/db/migrations/001_users.sql`

### Step 1.1: Schema & Migrations

#### Task 1.1.A: Create Notifications Table

**Description:**
Add a notifications table following existing schema patterns. This table stores
user notifications with support for read/unread status and different notification types.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] (CODE) Migration creates `notifications` table with columns: id, user_id, type, title, body, read, created_at
  - Verify: `src/lib/db/migrations/003_notifications.sql` includes column definitions
- [ ] (CODE) Foreign key constraint links to existing users table
  - Verify: migration file includes `FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)`
- [ ] (CODE) Index exists on user_id + created_at for efficient queries
  - Verify: migration file includes `CREATE INDEX` on `(user_id, created_at)`
- [ ] (TEST) Migration runs successfully (up and down)
  - Verify: test `should run migrations up and down`

**Files to Create:**
- `src/lib/db/migrations/003_notifications.sql` — migration file

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — add Notification type

**Existing Code to Reference:**
- `src/lib/db/migrations/001_users.sql` — follow migration patterns
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — follow type definition patterns

**Dependencies:** None

**Spec Reference:** Feature Spec > Data Model

**Browser Verification:**
- Criteria IDs: None
- Notes: N/A
