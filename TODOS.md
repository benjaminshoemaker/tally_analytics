# TODOs — Tally Analytics

## 🔴 Bugs

### Dependency Audit: `lodash` Prototype Pollution (moderate)
`pnpm audit --prod` reports `lodash@4.17.21` (via `recharts`) is vulnerable. Consider bumping `recharts` and/or adding a pnpm override to force `lodash>=4.17.23`.

**Priority:** Medium — not blocking, but should be cleaned up before launch

### Dependency Audit: `esbuild` Dev Server Vulnerability (moderate)
`pnpm audit` reports `esbuild@0.18.20` (via `drizzle-kit` → `@esbuild-kit/*`) is vulnerable. Consider updating the `@esbuild-kit/*` chain and/or `drizzle-kit` so `esbuild>=0.25.0` is used.

**Source:** `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate` (2026-01-24)
**Priority:** Medium — not blocking, but should be cleaned up before launch

### Docs Drift: `SECURITY.md` Still References Magic Link Auth (post-cleanup)
After removing magic link auth (Phase 4 of GitHub OAuth), `SECURITY.md` still references `apps/web/app/api/auth/verify/route.ts` and `E2E_TEST_MODE` behavior for `/api/auth/magic-link`.

**Source:** `SECURITY.md` (2026-01-24)
**Priority:** Low — docs-only, but worth updating for accuracy

### Auto-Generated PRs: Export/Import Naming Mismatch
The GitHub template generation exports `TallyAnalytics` but the generated import statement references `FastPrAnalytics`, causing build failures.

**Likely locations:**
- `apps/web/lib/github/templates/` — template generation code
- Wherever PR content is assembled

**Symptoms:**
- Build fails on generated PR code
- Manual fix required to change import name

**Priority:** High — breaks generated PRs

### SDK Bundle Size Limit Exceeded (Phase 2)
- [ ] **[P1 / Medium]** Reduce SDK bundle size below 3KB gzipped — Currently 4556 bytes; slim bundle or split optional exports

### Stripe Webhook Event Filter Audit
The billing verification harness filters the Stripe CLI listener to billing-relevant events. During an earlier unfiltered real-provider run, a `charge.succeeded` delivery received a 404 from the local Next dev server even though the billing flow itself succeeded. Audit the production webhook endpoint/event subscription settings before broadening listener coverage.

**Source:** Stripe billing verification harness implementation (2026-05-09)
**Priority:** Low — not blocking the focused billing harness, but worth checking before enabling broader Stripe webhook events

## 🟠 Revenue & Monetization

### Stripe Payment Integration
Stripe billing is implemented; run these manual verifications before launch.

**Manual verification checklist (ranked):**
1. [ ] Reconcile forbidden (security): User B calling `/api/stripe/reconcile` with User A’s `checkout_session_id` returns `403`.
2. [ ] Multi-subscription prevention: paid user re-submitting `/api/stripe/checkout` returns `409` + `manageUrl` (or redirects to portal).
3. [ ] Unknown price id safety: wrong `STRIPE_PRICE_*` does not downgrade user to `free` after a real `customer.subscription.updated`.
4. [ ] Webhook secret rotation: restart `stripe listen` (new `whsec_...`), update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, restart dev server; no signature failures.
5. [ ] `/pricing` wiring: logged-out CTAs go to GitHub install; logged-in free → checkout; logged-in paid → portal.
6. [ ] QuotaDisplay wiring: paid users never see “Upgrade plan”; free users do.

### Landing Page: Hero Secondary Link → "How it works"
Change the hero secondary link to scroll to the "How it works" section.

**Likely location:** `apps/web/components/marketing/hero.tsx`

---

### Landing Page: CTA Audit
Audit all CTAs on the main landing page for consistency (copy, destination, logged-in vs logged-out behavior).

**Likely locations:**
- `apps/web/components/marketing/navbar.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/marketing/hero.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/(marketing)/page.tsx`

---

### Docs Section Formatting
Improve formatting for the docs section (layout/typography/scanability).

**Likely locations:**
- `apps/web/app/(marketing)/docs/setup/page.tsx`
- Any landing-page docs section component (if separate)

---

### Demo Page
Create `/demo` route with static sample data so visitors can preview the dashboard without signing up.

**Location:** `apps/web/app/(marketing)/demo/page.tsx`

**Contents:**
- Fake 7-day analytics data
- Sample top pages, referrers
- Banner: "This is demo data. Connect your repo for real analytics."
- CTA to install GitHub App

---

### Social Proof Section
Add testimonials/logos section to marketing landing page.

**Location:** `apps/web/components/marketing/social-proof.tsx`
